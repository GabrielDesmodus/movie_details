# movie_details
Simple project for inheritance practice in Java.

-The program asks you, in a loop, to give informations about movies and then outputs these informations.

-The movies are divided by 2 classes, one is for movies released on Streaming Services, the other for movies released on Theaters.

-Both classes extend from the Movie class, which has a method that outputs the movie's general information.

-These subclasses override this method, calling the superclass method and making and aditional output on it.
